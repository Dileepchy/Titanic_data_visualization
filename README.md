## TITANIC DATASET: DATA VISUALIZATION AND PRESENTATION

Titanic Survival Analysis project, which aims to analyze passenger survival patterns using data visualization.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of passenger survival patterns on the Titanic. It utilizes data visualization to present insights into who survived the disaster.

## âœ… Features

- Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset.
- Data Visualization: Interactive and informative visualizations to understand survival trends.
- Survival Pattern Identification: Insights into factors influencing passenger survival.

## ğŸ¤– Technologies Used

The project is built using Python and leverages the following libraries for data analysis and visualization:

- Python: The core programming language.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.

## ğŸ“– Steps for Data visualization

* SECTION 1: Loading the Data
* SECTION 2: DATA PREPROCESSING AND CLEANING
* SECTION 3: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
       - 3.1 Survival Overview
       - 3.2 Demographic Analysis
* SECTION 4: DETAILED SURVIVAL ANALYSIS
       - 4.1 Survival by Multiple Factors
       - 4.2 Advanced Visualizations
* SECTION 5: STATISTICAL INSIGHTS AND PATTERNS
       - 5.1 Key Statistics
       - 5.2 Cross-tabulation Analysis
* SECTION 6: EXPLANATORY VISUALIZATIONS FOR PRESENTATION
        - 6.1 Executive Summary Dashboard
* SECTION 7: KEY FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS
       - Crafting new features for better analysis

## ğŸ˜² Feature: SibSp

SibSip feature indicates that whether a person is alone or with his family. Siblings=brother,sister, etc and Spouse= husband,wife

There are many interesting facts with this feature. Barplot and FactorPlot shows that if a passanger is alone in ship with no siblings, survival rate is 34.5%. The graph decreases as no of siblings increase. This is interesting because, If I have a family onboard, I will save them instead of saving myself. But there's something wrong, the survival rate for families with 5-8 members is 0%. Is this because of PClass? Yes this is PClass, The crosstab shows that Person with SibSp>3 were all in Pclass3. It is imminent that all the large families in Pclass3(>3) died.

That are some interesting facts we have observed with Titanic datase... ğŸ¤”ğŸ’¡
